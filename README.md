# bittrex_tools
Useful tools for managing your crypto-money on bittrex, and detecting potential trading signals.

# Getting started
Install Python if you don't already have it.  I like the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
Install dependencies: `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` (or just `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
Run some code: `python get_newest_markets.py`
I like to do it in iPython:
```bash
ipython
```

(in the iPython shell)
```
run get_newest_markets.py
```
